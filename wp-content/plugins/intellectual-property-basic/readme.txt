== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you provide any documentation? =

Yes! Check out the [detailed documentation](https://docs.google.com/a/thethinkery.net/document/d/1zhjcjC8Uo92N_y8JXezkYvUy-A7MBGBZioU2CkWnb1o/edit?pli=1) online.

= How do I get started? =

After installing the plugin, first add a new Company from the Users / Company menu in your WP-admin panel.
Next, add a new Agent via the WordPress Users menu. You will want to set the Role of the new user to Agent, and select the Company you just created as the User's Company.
Finally, you can add a property by using the Properties menu item.

For more, see the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.google.com/a/thethinkery.net/document/d/19AoJVI1ikQTVsNTZsPIZWzjl9u2TqsBwVA_I2mSoKJ0/) and the [User's Manual](https://docs.google.com/a/thethinkery.net/document/d/1zhjcjC8Uo92N_y8JXezkYvUy-A7MBGBZioU2CkWnb1o/edit?pli=1) or see our [YouTube video walk thru](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-aDOTksud4)

= How do I add Images? =

In the Add Property dialog, click the Add Media button. You can upload multiple images using the WP Image upload tool. Once the images you've selected are uploaded, you're done! You don't need to (or probably want to!) insert images into the post. IProperty will automatically create a gallery for you from the images you've uploaded.
